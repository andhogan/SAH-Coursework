# In this assignment, you’ll create a simplified model of a farm. 
# As you work through this assignment, keep in mind that there are a number of correct answers.

# The focus of this assignment is less about the Python class syntax and more about software design 
# in general, which is highly subjective. 
# This assignment is intentionally left open-ended to encourage you to think about how you would 
# organize your code into classes.

# Before you write any code, grab a pen and paper and sketch out a model of your farm, 
# identifying classes, attributes, and methods. 
# Think about inheritance. How can you prevent code duplication? 
# Take the time to work through as many iterations as you feel are necessary.

# The actual requirements are open to interpretation, but try to adhere to these guidelines:

# 1.You should have at least four classes: the parent Animal class, and then 
# at least three child animal classes that inherit from Animal.

# 2. Each class should have a few attributes 
# and at least one method that models some behavior appropriate for a specific animal or all animals
# —such as walking, running, eating, sleeping, and so on.

# 3. Keep it simple. Utilize inheritance. 
# Make sure you output details about the animals and their behaviors.
