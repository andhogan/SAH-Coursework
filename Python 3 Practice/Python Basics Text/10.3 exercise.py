# Exercise 1
# Create a GoldenRetriever class that inherits from the Dog class. 
# Give the sound argument of the GoldenRetriever.speak() method a default value of "Bark". 
# Use the following code for your parent Dog class:

class Dog:
    species = "Canis familiaris"

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old"

    def speak(self, sound):
        return f"{self.name} says {sound}"

# Create a GoldenRetriever class that inherits from the Dog class. 
class GoldenRetriever(Dog):
    # Give the sound argument of the GoldenRetriever.speak() method a default value of "Bark". 
    def speak(self, sound="Bark"):
        return super().speak(sound)
#Check work:
fido = GoldenRetriever("Fido", 5)
fido_speak = fido.speak()
print(fido_speak)
print(fido.speak())

# Exercise 2
# Write a Rectangle class that must be instantiated with two attributed: length and width. 
# Add a .area() method to the class that returns the area (length * width) of the rectangle. 
# Then write a Square class that inherits from the Rectangle class 
# and that is instantiated with a single attribute called side_length. 
# Test your Square class by instantiating a Square with a side_length of 4. 
# Calling the .area() method should return 16.

class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width

class Square(Rectangle):
    def __init__(self, side_length):
        super().__init__(side_length, side_length)

square = Square(4)
print(square.area())
